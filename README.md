# Visualizing-open-source-machine-learning-projects-on-GitHub
There are a lot of open source machine learning projects on GitHub and trying to make sense of them is
difficult. We can use visualization techniques to gain more insight into these projects. I want to
demonstrate the impact of corporates on open source machine learning projects on GitHub by
visualizing how many stars, commits, and contributors the projects have. We also analyze other factors
like companies, year and language of development.

I used the combination of R, Shiny, and r2d3 to implement this visualization project.

You can use RStudio to open and run app.R

Please find more details about the project in "Ali Abbas - Project.pdf"
